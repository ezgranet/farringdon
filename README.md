## Detail
Edward Johnston’s legendary hand-lettered forms, which are perhaps the height of English craft design, surpassing even ([as others have also argued](https://www.typotheque.com/articles/re-evaluation_of_gill_sans)), are about as suggestive of London and Britain as ‘Mind the Gap’ of the Changing of the Guard.  Although an excellent digitised version from ITC™ exists, a free version of his designs can only serve to help the world of typography.  Fortunately, Stephen Moye (famed as the author of *Fontographer*) created just such a digitised version decades ago, in the earlier more innocent days of the internet, and released it into the world, under the properly London name of Paddington.  Regrettably (and through no fault of my illustrious predecessor), the versions floating around on font hosting sites have numerous flaws in their metadata and are slightly suspect.  To make the world slightly nicer, I have, using at its core Mr Moye’s superb work, done some simple administrative changes such to make computers like these files more than they would the originals from the late 1990s.  This [will also hopefully solve the issue](https://github.com/google/fonts/issues/478) that has kept this typeface from Google Fonts.
## Nomenclature
The name of the typeface is taken from London’s Farringdon Station, which is home to a beautiful memorial to Mr Johnston, consisting of large quasi-punches illustrating the magnificence of his lettering.

## Licence
Mr Moye released his original design as ‘freeware’ without specifying the licence, but allowing all uses (such was the earlier Internet).  As Mr Moye did not restrict the future re-licensing of the typeface, I am relicensing it under the Open Font Licence, which allows for the free distribution, modification, and unlimited and unrestricted use of these fonts, which will keep them free and open while also providing legal certainty.
